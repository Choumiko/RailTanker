Adds a Rail Tanker to Factorio. This can be used to move any liquid around without having to barrel it up first

Note: Inserters can remove the used fake items from the railtanker, so be sure to not have inserters at a station where a railtanker might stop! Currently there is no way around it (besides making it not work with train conditions)
[Tank Wagon](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag/Tank%20Wagon) doesn't have this limitation, but needs additional work to work with conditions.

### Changelog:
1.3.33:

- changed icons for fake liquid items
- dynamic locale creation for modded liquids

1.3.32:

- fixed error when loading a game in Factorio 0.13.5
 - fixed crash when trying to connect a wire to the storage tank
 - added Ukrainian translation

1.3.31: 

   *  now works with vanilla train conditions (full/empty/item count/inactivity)
   *  Note: Inserters can remove the used fake items from the railtanker, so be sure to not have inserters at a station where a railtanker might stop! Currently there is no way around it
